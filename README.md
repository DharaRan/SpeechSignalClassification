# SpeechSignalClassification
Classification of 10 one-word speech commands using a convolutional neural network.
The word document contains some of the sources I used to start the project and my anaylsis of the project. I recommend reading that for guidance. The dataset is borrowed from the Goggle Tensorflow Speech Recogition Kaggle Competition.
The environment I used to run the project was on Google Colaboratory and its GPU as the run time.
The best accuracy my model gave is 73.08%.
